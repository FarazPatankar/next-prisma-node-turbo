## Scripts

- Scripts are one-off commands for populating data in the database
- To run a script, run: `ts-node PATH_TO_SCRIPT`
  - `rw run ts-node PATH_TO_SCRIPT` to use environment variables from Railway
- All execution commands are commented out by default so none of the scripts are executed by mistake
